#### A completely open, blank-slate Minecraft server implementation, implementing the Bukkit API. 

Prismarine is made to be lighter and more efficient than the vanilla server software and its derivatives, yet maintaining 
support for plugins designed for the Bukkit and Spigot APIs.


This project is a very early stage, without much to show off, but stay tuned!
